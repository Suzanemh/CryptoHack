## hexToBase64.py
This exercise demonstrates the process of converting data encoded in one format (hexadecimal) into another widely used format (Base64).

## bytesAndBigIntegers.py
This exercise shows how to work with large numbers by converting them from a numeric format (long integer) into a byte sequence, emphasizing the connection between numeric and textual representations of data, a key concept in cryptography and data encoding.

## XOR.py
This exercise demonstrates how to use the `xor` function from the `pwn` library to apply the XOR operation on a byte string (`label`) with a numeric value (13), showcasing how XOR can be used to encode or decode data in cryptography.

## XORProperties.py
The purpose of this exercise is to understand and apply **XOR properties** to decrypt data (the flag) by combining information encoded with multiple keys, without directly knowing all the keys.

## FavouriteByte.py
The goal of this task is to use XOR with all possible single-byte keys (from 0 to 255) to decrypt the given hex-encoded string, and identify the correct key by checking for the presence of the word "crypto" in the resulting output.

## xorMultiByte.py
The goal of this script is to decrypt a hexadecimal-encoded, XOR-encrypted message (flag) by first deriving the encryption key using a known plaintext prefix (crypto), and then using the key to reveal the full decrypted message.

## gcd.py
Using Euclid's Alghoritm to calculate gcd(a,b)

## ASCII.py
The code converts a list of ASCII values into a single string by mapping each value to its corresponding character and joining them together.

## extendenGCD.py
This code implements the **Extended Euclidean Algorithm**, which computes the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two integers \(a\) and \(b\), and also finds integers \(u\) and \(v\) such that \(a \cdot u + b \cdot v = \text{gcd}(a, b)\) (BÃ©zout's identity).

## congruence.py
This code calculates the modular reductions of two numbers (11 modulo 6 and 8146798528947 modulo 17), compares the results, and prints the smallest of the two values.

## fermatTheorem.py
This code calculates the modular exponentiation of a base raised to an exponent, modulo a given value, which is useful for applying Fermat's Little Theorem.

## modularInverting.py
This code calculates the multiplicative inverse of \( a = 7 \) modulo \( 11 \), meaning it finds the number \( x \) such that \( 7 \times x \equiv 1 \pmod{11} \), and then prints the result.
